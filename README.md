# 📌 Student Information System (Python)

This project is a simple console-based Student Information System built in Python.  
It allows users to manage student records by adding, viewing, and tracking students across different majors.


## ✨ Features

- Add new students with details such as:
  - Student ID
  - Full Name
  - Age
  - Classification (e.g., Freshman, Sophomore, etc.)
  - Major (Computer Science, Business, or Mathematics)
- Automatically keeps track of the total number of students registered
- Displays individual student details in a clean, formatted manner
- Uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles:
  - A base `Student` class for common attributes
  - Specialized subclasses for `ComputerScienceStudent`, `BusinessStudent`, and `MathematicsStudent`
- Provides a simple menu-driven interface for user interaction


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (OOP, classes, inheritance, encapsulation)


## 🎯 Learning Goals

This project was designed to:

-  Practice object-oriented design in Python
- Work with class inheritance and attributes
- Build a functional information management system with a user-friendly console interface
