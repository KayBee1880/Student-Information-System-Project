Student Management System
This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Python's Tkinter library. The system is designed to manage student records, including adding, removing, searching, and displaying student details. It also includes a basic user authentication system.
Features
Student Management
•	Add Student: Add a new student with details like ID, name, age, classification, and major.
•	Remove Student: Remove an existing student by providing their name and ID.
•	Search Student: Search for a student by their first and/or last name.
•	Display Student Count: View the total number of students and the number of students by major.
User Authentication
•	Login: Authenticate users with a username and password.
•	Sign Up: Create new user accounts with password validation.
•	Logout: Logout from the system and return to the login screen.
Additional Features
•	Dynamic Student Types: Students are categorized by major (e.g., Computer Science, Business, Arts, Engineering), with specialized behavior based on their type.
•	Error Handling: Validation checks ensure data integrity and user-friendly error messages.
Technologies Used
•	Python: Programming language used to implement the application.
•	Tkinter: Library used for creating the graphical user interface.
•	ttk: Used for modern widgets (e.g., dropdown menus).


How to Run the Application
Prerequisites
Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system. Tkinter is included with most Python installations by default.
Steps
1.	Clone the repository or download the project files.
2.	Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or IDE.
3.	Run the following command to start the application:
python <filename>.py
Replace <filename> with the name of the Python file containing the main() function.
4.	The application window will open. Use the login screen to authenticate or create a new user account.
File Structure
•	Main Application File: Contains the LoginSystem class and the entry point for the program.
•	Student Classes: Define specialized behavior for students based on their major (e.g., ComputerScienceStudent, BusinessStudent).
•	Data Persistence: Includes methods for saving and loading user and student data.

•	Logout by clicking the "Logout" button.
Future Enhancements
•	Add data export functionality (e.g., CSV or Excel).
•	Implement role-based access control.
•	Enhance the UI with themes or a modern library like PyQt.
•	Add analytics (e.g., charts for student distribution).
•	Improve search performance with optimized data structures.
